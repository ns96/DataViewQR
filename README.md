DataViewQR
===========

This is a Java/CodenameOne based mobile application which scan QR codes containing X,Y data and plots and performs basic analysis.

The basic idea behind this tool is to provide students/instructors with a quick way to plot/analyze data which integrates easily with current lab experiments. Though the storage capacity of QRCodes is somewhat limited, almost none of the typical chemistry lab experiments exceed this limit.

Since is based on QRCodes there is no need for any Bluetooth/WiFi connection to the instruments. Simply generate the QR code, then point and click, and allow the program to do the rest.

The ultimate goal to to extend the application support for many types of data, and to push for the generation of QR codes by the instrument software, or directly on the instruments themselves.
